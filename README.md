# alu_regex-data-extraction-acele-happy

The core of this application is a simple JavaScript program (`index.js`) that uses regular expressions to scan a text input and extract specific patterns. The app simulates text data and searches for matching patterns.

### How It Works

1. A block of sample text is defined in the `sampleText` variable.
2. Four different regex patterns are defined for each data type.
3. JavaScriptâ€™s `String.match()` method is used to apply these patterns to the text.
4. The extracted data is printed to the console in a readable format.

## How to Run
Make sure you have Node.js installed.

```bash
node index.js
